Native integration with System Platform through the new ITMEViewApp object


- Manage ITME applications from the ArchestrA IDE and centralized Galaxy Repository. Easily and naturally integrate and synchronize tag values, and alarm status from ITME runtime stations with System Platform.


- Launch the ITME IDE from System Platform, so the user can create/modify an ITME project.


- Store/Retrieve an ITME project from the ArchestrA System Repository.


- Automatically expose tags (including their values) from the ITME project as attributes of the object in System Platform.


- Automatically share the Alarm Status from the ITME project as attributes of the object in System Platform (including acknowledgment status).


- Allow the user to easily set tags from the ITME project to be saved into the Wonderware Historian.


- Deploy an ITME project to a runtime station from System Platform.


- Select and deploy the same project to several InTouch Machine Runtime â€“ maintaining thousands of complex relationships from a central place
